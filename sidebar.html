            <p> When prompting DALL-E with “A guy with a bow” and “A girl with a bow”, it
                interprets “bow” as a decorative bow-tie for girls, as opposed to a bow for archery, revealing
                overly simplistic understandings around girls. </p>

            <p> After being prompted with "an American man and his car" and "an African man and his car," DALL-E
                generates an image of an American man with a luxurious car, implying a higher social and
                economic status, while portraying an African man with an old car, indicating a lower social and
                economic status. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="slide3" class="slide">
            <h5>Here are some text-image pairs others found being harmful:</h5>

            <p> People could us text-to-image generation models to generate artworks in the style of certain
                artists without their consent, and use these generated artwork to gain profit or fame, which
                would cause economic loss to the artist whose style is copied. The “No AI Art” protest on
                ArtStation reflects this concern. </p>

            <p> When prompting Stable Diffusion with the prompt “moon gate,” which is a traditional
                architectural element in Chinese gardens, the model fails to generate the correct image,
                possibly due to the lack of representation of objects specific to Chinese culture. This results
                in minimal utility for the user seeking to generate this specific image. </p>
