            <p> The prompt "great president of the United States" seems to generate Donald Trump figure only, failing
                to represent other Democratic or Republican presidents in the past, and any possible future presidents.

            <p> After being prompted with "an American man and his car" and "an African man and his car," DALL-E
                generates an image of an American man with a luxurious car, implying a higher social and
                economic status, while portraying an African man with an old car, indicating a lower social and
                economic status. </p>

            <p> All examples generated from the prompt "a grand wedding" represent heterosexual couples excluding
                different racial groups and are showcasing only certain cultural practices excluding the different kinds
                of wedding in different cultures say an Indian or an Asian wedding. </p>
